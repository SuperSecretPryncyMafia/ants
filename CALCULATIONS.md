# Calculations and analysis

### The map
```
1     2     3
O-----O-----O
 \   / \   /
   -     -
```
Points are connected with paths. Path names will be local.


Point1:
- distance to 2 with path 1 is equal 1
- distance to 2 with path 2 is equal 2

Point2:
- distance to 3 with path 1 is equal 1
- distance to 3 with path 2 is equal 2

As first decision of the first ant we have probabilities:

|     |Point1|Point2|
|---- |------|------|
|Path1| 0.96 | 0.03 |
|Path2| 0.03 | 0.96 |
